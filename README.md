The model dynamics are designed using the Odin (Ordinary Differential Equation, ODE) solver developed by Imperial College MRC-IDE.
The model dynamics in base R are still in progress, and it is necessary to integrate the model into the transmission dynamics of Bancroftian filariasis (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, or TRANSFIL).
